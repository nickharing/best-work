# Polaroid SX-70 instant camera
"At the Polaroid company meeting in 1972, Edwin Land stepped onto the stage, pulled a camera out of his jacket pocket, and took five instant photos in ten seconds. That camera was the Polaroid SX-70, and it was the camera that made truly instant photography possible for the first time ever."  - https://us.polaroidoriginals.com/

I bought a few thrift-store SX-70s when Polaroid was still making film. The film's gel emulsion would not set right away, allowing the photographer to press against the photo with a stylus and distort the images. These are some of the photos I took and manipulated by hand to create an altered image.
