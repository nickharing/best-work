Wrangling unstructured data to reformat >300 documents

Recently, my group was tasked with reformatting and standardizing >300 Standard Operating Procedures, technical documents, each about 10-20 pages long. The expectation was our team would convert these documents manually over a year or two. Instead, we spent about 6 weeks learning how to use regex, grepl, and markdown to systematically scrape, edit, and reformat the documents.
