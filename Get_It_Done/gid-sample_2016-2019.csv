The cars are turning from a marked island (4 solid double yellow lines) into the driveway.

Racist Neighbor Alert! My boyfriend & I are moving our stuff right now out of our apartment on Thomas between Ingraham & Jewel.  The trucks are parked in the Alley between Thomas & Reed, and one of the trucks was blocking the alley. An older white woman with white hair, a border patrol hat, a blue-tooth & flashlight approached my boyfriend, who is Latino & acted like she was on the phone with the police on her Bluetooth. She told him he needed to move his truck because he was blocking the alley, so he told her he would, and she told him ?ÃƒÂndale!? He said excuse me, are you racist? And she replied ?Yes I am! And I bet there are a bunch of immigrants working here right now.? Referring to our movers, and the construction workers across the alley from us. She then told my boyfriend that she was recording him, and was calling 9-1-1 on him. He called & reported it to the non-emergency police line as well, but just wanted to put this out there for you guys to know. Unfortunately, we didn?t get a picture of her, but her behavior doesn?t represent the community that we have loved living in for the last few years, and so I had to say something, because my boyfriend, and any humans in general, don?t deserve to be treated this way. If you know of an older racist white lady who lives between Ingraham & Jewel, off of the Thomas & Reed alley, please let her know that this kind of behavior is pathetic, not tolerated anymore, and that we feel sorry for her, because she clearly has a sad life. Hope that no one else falls victim to her racism."

The problem: Other than a few lines painted on the alley, absolutely no work has been so far. And as I type this, the time is 7:35 a.m., and there are no workers in sight, despite the 7?5 parking restriction. This is unacceptable. Progress has not been made, so I plan to file a formal complaint with the city and am considering calling local media so others are aware of this type of problem.

It appears that when the repair was done, it was not adequately compacted, thus the upper right side is really sinking down and producing a very sharp bump.  This could be due to the erosion from all the rain, but the road is going to create a hazard since cars will have to veer right or left to avoid the extreme dip.

Monday-Friday around 5-6pm, I drive eastward on Balboa. When I'm stopped at a red light at the intersection, traffic is going southward on Genesee before it is my turn to have the green light. The issue I'm seeing is that when my light turns green, there is almost ALWAYS southward bound Genesee traffic blocking the intersection, sometimes even going as far back as to be blocking the Balboa to northward Genesee left turn lane. This always causes a delay and impedes the flow of traffic. Having to deal with it five days a week is not pleasant."

You have to be within 10 feet of the crosswalk before it notices that there is traffic when the left turn signal initiates for those turning left; then it will turn green and allow traffic to continue.  It used to always turn green for through traffic whenever the left turn signal turned green unless there are U-turns by eastbound traffic.  There is no reason to stop westbound traffic in this situation.  CALLE CRISTOBAL - SORRENTO VALLEY BLVD SHOULD BE CONSIDERED THE MAIN THOROUGHFARE AND TRAFFIC ALLOWED TO FLOW CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL TRIPPED ON CAMINO SANTA FE.

I hope you can approve this work so it can be done while they are here and the expense will be minimal, a lot less than having another crew come out to do the work.  Thank you for your help in this matter and I hope to hear from you soon.  Sorry I do not know how to send images.  Technology challenged."

Some of the trees are leaning across the street. It is not a question of if they will come down it is a question of when. The result of this is going to be a loss of life as some of these trees are at least 4 feet in diameter and at least 40-50 feet tall.  This is the 2nd or third time I have asked for something to be done about this and nothing has happened. I am not sure who is responsible for these trees but the city should at least investigate and find out. I say again when one of these trees falls someone is going to be seriously hurt and could very well lose their lives. This is an avoidable situation if someone would just look into and take corrective action.

Have a manhole #214 stretches 173' to manhole #206 and another 300' to manhole #205 all in residence back yard to access #214 enter on 4741 Beech St.  Please help prevent sewage flooding of our homes and chop up roots at minimum and check for collapse of sewer system. Urgent.  Received info from community members/councilman."

Not only were the sprinklers not repaired, the surface level sprinklers were placed well above ground, all the grass is dead and the bushes along the sidewalk are dying.  I'm guessing water is being emptied below surface and will eventually cause a void which will cause further problems.  I think it is reasonable for the city to return private property to the original state it was in prior to the repairs that were made to the sidewalk.  It does not seem fair or equitable that a private citizen should be responsible for damages caused to their property by the city during the repair of public access property."

There is an incline on Third Street and all the water accumulates at the intersection of Third and Date.  The water can be very deep when it floods.  I live at Westminster Manor, a senior living residence located at Third and Date.  There are over 150 senior residents who live at Westminster Manor, and many have walkers, wheelchairs and scooters.  When the sidewalk and crosswalk flood, the seniors using assistive devices have no way to cross Third street without going through the deep flooding.  To avoid the water when crossing Third, you have to step off the curb 30 feet outside the crosswalk, and risk being hit by oncoming traffic.  I have seen several near misses, when a pedestrian was almost hit by a car. In addition to being located by a senior residence, there is a school and a church also located at Third and Date, resulting in heavy pedestrian and car traffic at certain times of the day.     Given the special condition of being located adjacent to a senior residence, and the school and church across the street, this project should be given high priority. I believe that this problem could be fixed by drilling a drainage hole.  The water would fall onto the vegetation below.  Please contact me by telephone to let me know whether this project is approved to be fixed, the timeline, and whether there is funding or if the project will go on the unfunded approved list. Thank you for your time and consideration, Walter Wickins"

Now the bump due to your asphalt patch work is so high which has caused another hazard to the problem, the other day our neighbor(Robin Oswald) almost fell on the ground because of this problem   and she is a witness to this description. It makes sense to take the whole section out and do the right repair work or to minimize the damage to the underground water supply pipe and avoid  accident to the pedestrians walking in the area.Sincerely Cyrus Sheikh"

The high garden wall on the corner limits visibility. Anytime I wait for a bus, 4 stop there, for 10 minutes at least one car will attempt a right hand turn into oncoming one way traffic headed west. Simple put, the poor directional markings and the non existing traffic light over the 4 lanes is a big problem. This is an intersection I cross,as a pedestrian daily to reach my apartment."

We'd like to be able to have these cars ticketed and potentially towed away more promptly than the current process allows.  Thanks for your consideration.

One at the extreme southeast end of the cul-de-sac at a then existing driveway entrance and a second one in the parkway directly across from my home. Sometime after 2003 when my neighbor, Craig Irving, bought the three undeveloped parcels across from me to build a single family residence on the now combined property (4095 Lomaland Drive) both street lights were removed during construction since his improvements included the under grounding of the existing power lines. No replacement street lighting was installed after the removal of power poles. During the last few years since entry into the adjacent nature park was made accessible we have had a significant increase in traffic which unfortunately includes much illegal night time activity including, but certainly not limited to, over night camping, public urination and defecation, under age drinking, drug use, fornication and daily litter related to all of the above. It presents an unsafe condition for both my family and the young families that have recently moved into the immediate neighborhood. I am requesting that an individual light post be reinstalled at the previous location directly across from my home in the interest of discouraging the illegal behavior we have had to tolerate for far too long. Thank you for your attention to this matter, Tom Hayes"

Additionally, the striping is faded and the crosswalks are set up in such a way that it creates a safety hazard for the kids (cross walk does not go to the side walk of the school, but to the curb where there is no place to safely go to the school)  VERY concerned for our military families that live in that area, also for the seniors that live in the community next door to the school.  Many bad sidewalks in this area and it makes it dangerous for the elderly to walk in that area (we see people walking with walkers and canes in this area daily)  Please repair!

We operate a retail show room on the street (1275 West Morena Blvd) and the 4 hour limit was placed by the city to preserve the sidewalk space for potential customers. The picture shows one car but the business next-door probably has 4 to 6 employees so they're about 4 to 6 cars that are staying parked on the street for longer than four hours. Unfortunately the meter maid never comes by so the problem will continue unless the four hour limit is enforced.

No response to the issue. Our neighbor is either not home or refuses to answer the door. Between 15 & 20 years he has never stepped foot in his backyard. It's an overgrown jungle which I would think would be a fire hazard since the growth is in the power lines. But my biggest worry is the giant Torrey Pine which has never ever been attended to. I worry during every breath of wind or heavy rain, myself & husband or our tenants will be crushed! What am I suppose to do when our neighbor will not talk to us. We haven't seen him in months which is not unusual. Also this last year the sewer was replaced in our alley which the city cut out roots before resurfacing. The roots had raised our alley so high we had to cut the bottom of our gate by 3 feet just to be able to open it. Now that the roots have been cut did that compromise its strength? We would appreciate some help before another tragedy!"

For whatever reason when the lamp was installed they put in s sodium lamp vs LED that have been installed with new lamp posts.

Half a block away the city is in the process of making significant improvements to Park De La Cruz.  Approximately 2 months ago homeless camps have started to spring up in the alley behind our property adjacent to the park, which many families and small children use daily.  PD has been called for multiple disturbances with no improvement.  At this time another camp has sprung up on the other side of the alley and the homeless population/disturbances have increased.  This is also causing loud noises/fights at night and the area is quickly starting to look similar to East Village.  Meanwhile many small children attend the school, visit the park and walk the area.  No doubt drug use happening, and pretty reasonable to assume weapons could be at these camps posing a danger.  Kelvin Barrios is aware of the issue and agrees this needs to be addressed ASAP."

Acadia Blvd.  He explained to us that during large rain events the water does not run along the channel due to high amounts of vegetation and sediment build up that are within the ditch.  This causes flooding and water build up on Mt. Acadia Blvd at the bottom of the hill.  As this is a fairly busy road and cars can travel at high speeds coming down the hills in this area this flooding can potentially cause a safety hazard.  Furthermore, the resident informed us that he has tried to use the Get it Done App to have this matter looked at with no avail and he was looking into moving the matter up through City Council and other avenues.  Brandon and I took some photos of the area of concern and a map of the area is also included below."

The evening commute should favor this direction of traffic, whereas in the mornings, most traffic is getting on the 5S (opposite direction). The result on this day was that every driver was so incensed by this that they drove 65 mph the rest of the way up Sorrento Valley Blvd and into Mira Mesa.

Better yet, please make it left arrow green all the time, because this is a T-intersection and there is very minimal traffic going right to that little part of the road.

I purchased my home in La Jolla shores in 1969 and since the 1970's i have been aware of damage to  homes in this area caused by underground water. Also, I have been a licensed real estate agent since 1980 and I have observed much of the damage to the homes. Yesterday Sally Wegner, who resides at 2331 Calle Corta sent me the email as follows:""I just gave up fighting my water problems over the holidays and now with the rain it's impossible.  What I have gathered is that it must be underground water coming from the direction of Angie's going under K's driveway and under mine and the garage to the house.  The angle of the ground slope is right for that.  The garage  floor has been damp and it isn't from the car's AC draining.  Is there anything the City can/will do to stop it if it is underground water?""Sally Wegner has contacted you before regarding this problem and you did not have a solution for her.  Please see email dated November 5, 2018 below) Since the 1980's I have had listings for Sale and Rent on Calle Corta.  We have endured many problems with UNDERGROUND WATER especially after a heavy rain.After looking at the location of the current STORM DRAINS in La Jolla Shores, (Maps provided to me by David Wells.) I believe a STORM DRAIN SHOULD BE INSTALLED  AT THE INTERSECTION OF AVENIDA DE LAS ONDAS AND CALLE CORTA to provide relief from  the flow of underground water damage.This UNDERGROUND RIVERBED PROBABLY GOES ALL THE WAY TO THE OCEAN AND ENDS AT 8466 , 8470 AND 8486 EL PASEO GRANDE...I have also marked on the enclosed map some immediate  areas of La Jolla Shores that I can document the underground water problem. if you would like additional information, please contact me. Please read the previous email on November 5, 2018 for more information.You may contact Sally Wegner -phone 858 454-1450 and her address is 2331 Calle Corta, La JollaMy contact number is 858 459-4844 and my email is peggydavis@san.rr.com.Thank you for your attention to this most important problem.Cordially,Peggy DavisPREVIOUS EMAIL TO DAVID WELLS, CITY OF SAN DIEGO ON NOVEMBER 5, 2018Peggy Davis <peggydavislajolla@gmail.com>	Mon, Nov 5, 2018, 1:32 PM		  to David, Sally, bcc: Peggy 	David Wells:Several months ago your Storm Water and Transportation Department  were so very gracious in supplying me  with maps of storm drains for certain areas of La Jolla.Now I have a neighbor. Sally Wegner, who resides at 2331 Calle Corta, who has been experiencing a underground water problem at her residence for many months. Sally has contacted many people at the City of San Diego Storm Water Department and no help has been received for her problem.Sally Wegner has tried to contact Bill Harris many times by phone and email and for some reason he has not replied.  I told Sally that Bill Harris was a Customer Service Program Manager and was extremely helpful when I requested copies of the maps.  For some reason he has not returned her calls.Sally Wegner has paid plumbers and other people to inspect the problem at her home. Now comments have been made  by plumbers that it could be an UNDERGROUND STORM WATER DRAIN PROBLEM.Please place an order for an inspection of Calle Corta for storm drains.  There is an old UNDERGROUND RIVER BED in this area, I saw the map in the 1980's, unable to find the map now.  In the past 36 years I have seen water underneath the homes, on CALLE  CORTA, when we have experienced a BIG RAIN. The home at 2337 Calle Corta had to be demolished and rebuilt in past years due to a water problem. In fact this underground riverbed goes all the way to the ocean to the 8400 El Paseo Grande.I appreciate your assistance, I know you are extremely busy and Sally Wegner will look forward to hearing from you.The phone number for Sally Wegner is 858 454-1450 and her address is 2331 Calle Corta.

His parking lot is riddled with trash and the only clean up i have seen is a man with a leaf blower blowing trash into the ally where my family and i live. I believe because of this ""trashy"" ally transients take up residence here. There is currently someone living behind a dumpster up the ally and for weeks a man lived on north park produces property right in front of their store.

All are located along Salk Institute Road, east of North Torrey Pines Road. 1. Trash Discharge - Grated inlet to the west of the western driveway on Salk Institute Rd. The grated inlet was dry but was littered with a high volume of cigarette butts. (Figure 2 and 3). 2. Water Discharge - Grated inlet on the eastern side of the western driveway. Here there was a PVC pipe that entered from the north that was flowing at a rate of approximately 0.3 gallons per minute. We were unable to remove the grated inlet and the slits were too narrow to take any samples. The upstream portions of this system are not mapped and are likely private. Photos taken at this location were lost. 3. Water Discharge - Grated inlet on the eastern side of the western building near the handicap and deliveries driveway. Here there was a PVC pipe that entered from the north that was flowing at a rate of approximately 0.1 gallons per minute. We were unable to remove the grated inlet and the slits were too narrow to take any samples. The upstream portions of this system are not mapped and are likely private. Photos taken at this location were lost. 4. Inquire - Manhole in the grass between the eastern most driveway cutouts on Salk Institute Rd. Here the manhole was ajar with some equipment nearby. As we did not know what this setup was we did not attempt to move or open the manhole or equipment. The downstream location where this structure is mapped to drain to was dry. There does not appear to be a discharge here, but more information regarding what this setup was would be beneficial. (Figure 4)."
