The latest inconvenience has been that residents in the immediate vicinity of the alley pictured have been banned by the City from parking in their own off-street parking spaces: first last Monday through Wednesday, 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. and now today (Monday) through this Wednesday. The problem: Other than a few lines painted on the alley, absolutely no work has been so far. And as I type this, the time is 7:35 a.m., and there are no workers in sight, despite the 7?5 parking restriction. This is unacceptable. Progress has not been made, so I plan to file a formal complaint with the city and am considering calling local media so others are aware of this type of problem. Residents don't pay taxes to have shoddy roads and restricted parking for no good reason."

One at the extreme southeast end of the cul-de-sac at a then existing driveway entrance and a second one in the parkway directly across from my home. Sometime after 2003 when my neighbor, Craig Irving, bought the three undeveloped parcels across from me to build a single family residence on the now combined property (4095 Lomaland Drive) both street lights were removed during construction since his improvements included the under grounding of the existing power lines. No replacement street lighting was installed after the removal of power poles. During the last few years since entry into the adjacent nature park was made accessible we have had a significant increase in traffic which unfortunately includes much illegal night time activity including, but certainly not limited to, over night camping, public urination and defecation, under age drinking, drug use, fornication and daily litter related to all of the above. It presents an unsafe condition for both my family and the young families that have recently moved into the immediate neighborhood. I am requesting that an individual light post be reinstalled at the previous location directly across from my home in the interest of discouraging the illegal behavior we have had to tolerate for far too long. Thank you for your attention to this matter, Tom Hayes"

All are located along Salk Institute Road, east of North Torrey Pines Road. 1. Trash Discharge - Grated inlet to the west of the western driveway on Salk Institute Rd. The grated inlet was dry but was littered with a high volume of cigarette butts. (Figure 2 and 3). 2. Water Discharge - Grated inlet on the eastern side of the western driveway. Here there was a PVC pipe that entered from the north that was flowing at a rate of approximately 0.3 gallons per minute. We were unable to remove the grated inlet and the slits were too narrow to take any samples. The upstream portions of this system are not mapped and are likely private. Photos taken at this location were lost. 3. Water Discharge - Grated inlet on the eastern side of the western building near the handicap and deliveries driveway. Here there was a PVC pipe that entered from the north that was flowing at a rate of approximately 0.1 gallons per minute. We were unable to remove the grated inlet and the slits were too narrow to take any samples. The upstream portions of this system are not mapped and are likely private. Photos taken at this location were lost. 4. Inquire - Manhole in the grass between the eastern most driveway cutouts on Salk Institute Rd. Here the manhole was ajar with some equipment nearby. As we did not know what this setup was we did not attempt to move or open the manhole or equipment. The downstream location where this structure is mapped to drain to was dry. There does not appear to be a discharge here, but more information regarding what this setup was would be beneficial. (Figure 4)."

I had my back to the sidewalk moving away from the sidewalk on my lawn then all at once, loud barking and jumping up at me.  My heart stopped.  When I realized what was happening, I looked for the owner of the animal who was fifty feet away walking with the dogs leash over her shoulder.  When I asked why her dog was not on a leash, she said she has one and can use it and that I should just calm down.  I reported this by phone to Animal Control at the beginning of November.

The team was running on the south side of the Camino del Norte sidewalk adjacent to the eastbound Camino del Norte traveling traffic lanes.  As my daughter was running she tripped on a base of a metal street sign post  base that had not been fully removed.  The elevated metal street sign base post was bent is elevated approximately 5 inches above from the sidewalk.  Upon tripping she fell hard onto her right knee primarily but also onto her left knee and hands.  The severity of her fall caused two cars driving on eastbound on Camino del Norte to stop and assist in helping my daughter.  My daughter had to be driven back to Del Norte High School with her coach due to an inability to put pressure on her right knee while running.   I am filing a complaint to get the metal post removed completely and I am also requesting to file an injury report with the City of San Diego.  Please send me the proper paperwork for filing this injury report to ghayes01@cox.net.  I request some contact me on Tuesday, 09-06-16 about this hazardous incident and who the proper contact for fixing the hazard and filing the injury to the City of San Diego.

I was also told by the owner that the trash in the ally was a city issue, but if 90%of the trash in the ally is from North Park produce, where does the environmental solution come from? His parking lot is riddled with trash and the only clean up i have seen is a man with a leaf blower blowing trash into the ally where my family and i live. I believe because of this ""trashy"" ally transients take up residence here. There is currently someone living behind a dumpster up the ally and for weeks a man lived on north park produces property right in front of their store. Anyway, i tried to contact the owner and he blew me off. Just trying to keep the outside of my home clean and trash from blowing into the drainage system that washes into our oceans.

I would say it is about 3 x 5 feet, most of which is in the right lane going north.  It appears that when the repair was done, it was not adequately compacted, thus the upper right side is really sinking down and producing a very sharp bump.  This could be due to the erosion from all the rain, but the road is going to create a hazard since cars will have to veer right or left to avoid the extreme dip.  If one veers to the left, you are going into the other lane on a curve.  Not a good idea  I feel the problem should be addressed and corrected asap."

West Washington Street from India Street TO Pacific Highway is a complete disgrace and in absolute shambles.  There are so many ruts and potholes with the combination of the old train tracks that it makes a for a very rough ride and I am sure multiple flat tires have been casualties.  I will say it makes even the homeless folks hanging around on the corners look clean and well kept.  This issue needs to be replaced and dealt with.  I am requesting Chris Ward and Lorie Zapf for which this section of the road is lies between Districts 2 and 3 to drive back and forth between the Pacific Hwy and Gelato Vero Caffe  three times at the speed limit and see who doesn't spill an open lid cup of coffee first.

This driveway leads down the hill and is sometimes staffed with a security guard who has routinely encouraged drivers to make this illegal turn.  I have been almost hit by cars doing this at least 5 times, most recently this morning when a white BMW pulled across the northbound lane and stopped.  The cars are turning from a marked island (4 solid double yellow lines) into the driveway.  Someone has also painted out part of the island immediately in front of the driveway being accessed (painted over the yellow lines) perhaps to give the impression that this is a legal turn, even though it is not.  Please restore the street markings and cite cars making this dangerous and illegal turn.  In addition, I would think it is inappropriate for private staff to be controlling traffic on a public roadway, doubly so if they are creating unsafe behavior."

I spoke to the workmen and was  assured they would repair all of the sprinklers broken and the lawn area would be returned to its original condition.  Not only were the sprinklers not repaired, the surface level sprinklers were placed well above ground, all the grass is dead and the bushes along the sidewalk are dying.  I'm guessing water is being emptied below surface and will eventually cause a void which will cause further problems.  I think it is reasonable for the city to return private property to the original state it was in prior to the repairs that were made to the sidewalk.

Central at sdpdcentral@pd.sandiego.gov,"Since September of 2016 there have been 15-20 homeless encampments on the sidewalks surrounding the LAZ parking lot on F Street, between 7th Avenue and 8th Avenue.  We think the homeless on these sidewalks had previously occupied the sidewalks near the US Post Office located on 9th Avenue and E Street.   Now, the sidewalk just outside our office (located on 7th Avenue and F Street) is across from the homeless people and their dogs.  The homeless individuals who have set up tents and are camping out around the parking lot are creating both a nuisance and health hazards.  The new homeless encampment obstructs the sidewalk and entrance to the parking lot that is utilized by our paralegal.   There has been significant open drug use by the homeless people in this area. We are concerned for the safety of our staff members who will be forced to go around the homeless encampments in the dark to reach the parking lot after work.  We are also concerned about the trash and human waste that is being left by the people in this encampment.  We have called Clean & Safe San Diego daily regarding this issue, but the problem persists.  We would appreciate your intervention in this matter.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at 888.812.5117, ext 2445 or David Parker at 888.812.5117, ext 2443.  Thank you,Jackie Spivey, Legal Assistant"

There is an incline on Third Street and all the water accumulates at the intersection of Third and Date.  The water can be very deep when it floods.  I live at Westminster Manor, a senior living residence located at Third and Date.  There are over 150 senior residents who live at Westminster Manor, and many have walkers, wheelchairs and scooters.  When the sidewalk and crosswalk flood, the seniors using assistive devices have no way to cross Third street without going through the deep flooding.  To avoid the water when crossing Third, you have to step off the curb 30 feet outside the crosswalk, and risk being hit by oncoming traffic.  I have seen several near misses, when a pedestrian was almost hit by a car. In addition to being located by a senior residence, there is a school and a church also located at Third and Date, resulting in heavy pedestrian and car traffic at certain times of the day.     Given the special condition of being located adjacent to a senior residence, and the school and church across the street, this project should be given high priority. I believe that this problem could be fixed by drilling a drainage hole.  The water would fall onto the vegetation below.  Please contact me by telephone to let me know whether this project is approved to be fixed, the timeline, and whether there is funding or if the project will go on the unfunded approved list. Thank you for your time and consideration, Walter Wickins"

Now the bump due to your asphalt patch work is so high which has caused another hazard to the problem, the other day our neighbor(Robin Oswald) almost fell on the ground because of this problem   and she is a witness to this description. It makes sense to take the whole section out and do the right repair work or to minimize the damage to the underground water supply pipe and avoid  accident to the pedestrians walking in the area.Sincerely Cyrus Sheikh"

Cross a street there is a drain. Its gonna be a speed bump and help people to cross red light too. So if the water is going through the water pipe to cross a street. It will not make a wet street and no more pothole.

It's an overgrown jungle which I would think would be a fire hazard since the growth is in the power lines. But my biggest worry is the giant Torrey Pine which has never ever been attended to. I worry during every breath of wind or heavy rain, myself & husband or our tenants will be crushed! What am I suppose to do when our neighbor will not talk to us. We haven't seen him in months which is not unusual. Also this last year the sewer was replaced in our alley which the city cut out roots before resurfacing. The roots had raised our alley so high we had to cut the bottom of our gate by 3 feet just to be able to open it. Now that the roots have been cut did that compromise its strength? We would appreciate some help before another tragedy!"

Northern at sdpdnorthern@pd.sandiego.gov,"FYI: Saw this post on social PB, the responses make it seems like someone needs mental health evaluation before she goes too far. Racist Neighbor Alert! My boyfriend & I are moving our stuff right now out of our apartment on Thomas between Ingraham & Jewel.  The trucks are parked in the Alley between Thomas & Reed, and one of the trucks was blocking the alley. An older white woman with white hair, a border patrol hat, a blue-tooth & flashlight approached my boyfriend, who is Latino & acted like she was on the phone with the police on her Bluetooth. She told him he needed to move his truck because he was blocking the alley, so he told her he would, and she told him ?ÃƒÂndale!? He said excuse me, are you racist? And she replied ?Yes I am! And I bet there are a bunch of immigrants working here right now.? Referring to our movers, and the construction workers across the alley from us. She then told my boyfriend that she was recording him, and was calling 9-1-1 on him. He called & reported it to the non-emergency police line as well, but just wanted to put this out there for you guys to know. Unfortunately, we didn?t get a picture of her, but her behavior doesn?t represent the community that we have loved living in for the last few years, and so I had to say something, because my boyfriend, and any humans in general, don?t deserve to be treated this way. If you know of an older racist white lady who lives between Ingraham & Jewel, off of the Thomas & Reed alley, please let her know that this kind of behavior is pathetic, not tolerated anymore, and that we feel sorry for her, because she clearly has a sad life. Hope that no one else falls victim to her racism."

Acadia Blvd.  He explained to us that during large rain events the water does not run along the channel due to high amounts of vegetation and sediment build up that are within the ditch.  This causes flooding and water build up on Mt. Acadia Blvd at the bottom of the hill.  As this is a fairly busy road and cars can travel at high speeds coming down the hills in this area this flooding can potentially cause a safety hazard.  Furthermore, the resident informed us that he has tried to use the Get it Done App to have this matter looked at with no avail and he was looking into moving the matter up through City Council and other avenues.  Brandon and I took some photos of the area of concern and a map of the area is also included below."

A ""resolved"" response has been received, it is not resolved, as previously stated by many neighbors, the bulb is not and LED, hence it puts out very little light, barely lights the pavement underneath the lamp post, reason someone ran into it, they didn't see it in the dark. For whatever reason when the lamp was installed they put in s sodium lamp vs LED that have been installed with new lamp posts. It simply is inadequate, not near as bright as the older bulbs, it does pose a safety issue. I'm hoping an LED will be installed when the other two lamps will get replaced (Locust / Dumas and Clove / Dumas. Thanks for your attention to this issue"

Approximately 2 months ago homeless camps have started to spring up in the alley behind our property adjacent to the park, which many families and small children use daily.  PD has been called for multiple disturbances with no improvement.  At this time another camp has sprung up on the other side of the alley and the homeless population/disturbances have increased.  This is also causing loud noises/fights at night and the area is quickly starting to look similar to East Village.  Meanwhile many small children attend the school, visit the park and walk the area.  No doubt drug use happening, and pretty reasonable to assume weapons could be at these camps posing a danger.  Kelvin Barrios is aware of the issue and agrees this needs to be addressed ASAP."

The result of this is going to be a loss of life as some of these trees are at least 4 feet in diameter and at least 40-50 feet tall.  This is the 2nd or third time I have asked for something to be done about this and nothing has happened. I am not sure who is responsible for these trees but the city should at least investigate and find out.

Also, I have been a licensed real estate agent since 1980 and I have observed much of the damage to the homes. Yesterday Sally Wegner, who resides at 2331 Calle Corta sent me the email as follows:""I just gave up fighting my water problems over the holidays and now with the rain it's impossible.  What I have gathered is that it must be underground water coming from the direction of Angie's going under K's driveway and under mine and the garage to the house.  The angle of the ground slope is right for that.  The garage  floor has been damp and it isn't from the car's AC draining.  Is there anything the City can/will do to stop it if it is underground water?""Sally Wegner has contacted you before regarding this problem and you did not have a solution for her.  Please see email dated November 5, 2018 below) Since the 1980's I have had listings for Sale and Rent on Calle Corta.  We have endured many problems with UNDERGROUND WATER especially after a heavy rain.After looking at the location of the current STORM DRAINS in La Jolla Shores, (Maps provided to me by David Wells.) I believe a STORM DRAIN SHOULD BE INSTALLED  AT THE INTERSECTION OF AVENIDA DE LAS ONDAS AND CALLE CORTA to provide relief from  the flow of underground water damage.This UNDERGROUND RIVERBED PROBABLY GOES ALL THE WAY TO THE OCEAN AND ENDS AT 8466 , 8470 AND 8486 EL PASEO GRANDE...I have also marked on the enclosed map some immediate  areas of La Jolla Shores that I can document the underground water problem. if you would like additional information, please contact me. Please read the previous email on November 5, 2018 for more information.You may contact Sally Wegner -phone 858 454-1450 and her address is 2331 Calle Corta, La JollaMy contact number is 858 459-4844 and my email is peggydavis@san.rr.com.Thank you for your attention to this most important problem.Cordially,Peggy DavisPREVIOUS EMAIL TO DAVID WELLS, CITY OF SAN DIEGO ON NOVEMBER 5, 2018Peggy Davis <peggydavislajolla@gmail.com>	Mon, Nov 5, 2018, 1:32 PM		  to David, Sally, bcc: Peggy 	David Wells:Several months ago your Storm Water and Transportation Department  were so very gracious in supplying me  with maps of storm drains for certain areas of La Jolla.Now I have a neighbor. Sally Wegner, who resides at 2331 Calle Corta, who has been experiencing a underground water problem at her residence for many months. Sally has contacted many people at the City of San Diego Storm Water Department and no help has been received for her problem.Sally Wegner has tried to contact Bill Harris many times by phone and email and for some reason he has not replied.  I told Sally that Bill Harris was a Customer Service Program Manager and was extremely helpful when I requested copies of the maps.  For some reason he has not returned her calls.Sally Wegner has paid plumbers and other people to inspect the problem at her home. Now comments have been made  by plumbers that it could be an UNDERGROUND STORM WATER DRAIN PROBLEM.Please place an order for an inspection of Calle Corta for storm drains.  There is an old UNDERGROUND RIVER BED in this area, I saw the map in the 1980's, unable to find the map now.  In the past 36 years I have seen water underneath the homes, on CALLE  CORTA, when we have experienced a BIG RAIN. The home at 2337 Calle Corta had to be demolished and rebuilt in past years due to a water problem. In fact this underground riverbed goes all the way to the ocean to the 8400 El Paseo Grande.I appreciate your assistance, I know you are extremely busy and Sally Wegner will look forward to hearing from you.The phone number for Sally Wegner is 858 454-1450 and her address is 2331 Calle Corta.

It is not a pothole but a HUGE hole that takes up a quarter of the lane and with cars next to you you cannot avoid.  The AAA tow truck driver told me he has seen 10-15 cars affected by this PER DAY.  What is going on San Diego?????? You are doing a major construction project on this bridge - how can you not know this is there?
