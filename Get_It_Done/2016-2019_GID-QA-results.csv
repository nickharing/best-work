It appears as though the weight sensor on the east side of college on Adelaide (if you were driving west on Adelaide waiting for the light on college) is stuck. No matter what time of day or traffic configuration, the light always has to cycle through a green for this direction. That means if you are northbound on college and want to turn left (west) onto Adelaide, you have to wait for the light to go through a cycle for westbound Adelaide first. The reciprocal does not apply if you are eastbound on Adelaide. I am pretty certain the weight sensor got messed up when they resurfaced that section of Adelaide. This causes undue delay and always makes an unecceasary cycle of the light even when no cars are westbound on Adelaide. Feel free to call me at 619-322-4892 to further explain.

I live at 12201 Malabar Drive in Poway.  My residential property borders Camino Del Norte (just east of World Trade Drive) and my west property line is the San Diego/Poway boundary.  A S.D. city storm drain from a City subdivision (see map no. 11511) empties onto my property.  There is a 2' diameter palm tree growing out of the rip rap in front of the pipe outlet.  It should be removed so that it does block the pipe outflow.  The outlet and the rip rap are both within the city boundary.  Your crew was out several years ago and cleaned out blockage just inside of the pipe exit.  I request that the City crews remove the palm tree before we get to far into the rain season.

87135,NA,40300027688,2016-10-28T13:14:00,955,Evaluate for Resurfacing,TSW,,In Process,32.7099332,-96.9802764,NA,NA,,,Mobile,,"To Whom It May Concern:The following residence, 1818 Granada Avenue has undergone consequential damage due to street renovations conducted by The City of San Diego.  Specifically, the repaving of the street in front of this property has occurred 4 times in the past 12 years and lead to a significant difference in height between the new asphalt and original street.  There is approximately a 5 inch gap between the elevated asphalt and side walk that retains rain water that then leads onto the property.  Especially, when rapid rainfall occurs this gap can lead significantly dangerous amounts of water onto the property and overcome all our preventative measures.In our own attempts to prevent our property?s garage from being inundated we have implemented sand bags and provisional dam structures on the property line.  However, this has not entirely obstructed the heavy rain filled in the gap from rapidly flooding onto the property.Additionally, the ineffective placement of storm drains has prevented rain water?s ability to properly drain prevent street flooding.  Our property is on the lowest point in a 5 block radius and thus makes it very difficult for runoff, let alone excessive rain water to make it to any near storm drain.  Therefore the city?s placement of the drain does not properly drain rain water, in which the excess water instead rushes downhill and inundates our property.  Additionally, the repaving of the street has over-layed the gutter, which during heavy rain backflows the water, which can then jump the curb and further redirects the flow of water onto the property.  If the city had implemented the correct elevation and grade of the street water would flow into gutter and reach storm drain.  This has not only caused property damage estimated to be in the tens of thousands of dollars, but also initiates threatening environmental implications.  Studies provided by the US National Library of Medicine National Institute of Health, have shown that consistent flood damage, like that our property has incurred leads to an introduction of harmful pathogens, contaminated microbial growth, and other sanitary [1].  This leads tenants susceptible to public health risks that ultimately requires us to lower tenants rent rates and impact our overall property value.Especially, with the near rainy season, there is an imminent need to have this problem addressed.  Currently, we see the only means of fixing this problem is the streets being ground down to diminish the consolidation of rain water from the street and then onto our property.  Another means of mitigating this issue is having a more effective storm drain put in place.  We are open to suggested methods to solve this issue and look forward to your response.  Additional supporting videos and evidence can be provided digitally. Although we received a denial letter from our claim with The City of San Diego, we dispute the response that our claim was denied as your denial blamed the flooding was a result of TC Construction working in that area.This is an ongoing problem that we have tried to address this with City of San Diego, claim #: 12713 and San Diego Storm Water, claim #: 15-680496.  We have made numerous attempts to successfully contact your offices and have called over a dozen times.  We have been able to speak with Chris Glascon Storm; Water Senior Engineer Supervisor Gene Matter; Supervisor, and Chris Griffin; Risk Manager.  We are requesting your immediate attention.

Traffic is constantly backed up into intersection westbound on Miramar Road and does not move. Westbound Miramar Road signals are out of sync, turning red in front of traffic just as you get a green light, backed up all the way past Kearney Villa Road. When a little space opens up ahead of you at a red light, traffic then infills from northbound offramp from I-15 and blocks intersection. When your light turns green, you cannot move forward due to blockage of intersection. The infilled traffic eventually almost clears the intersection and then your light turns red so you cannot enter the intersection. This repeats signal after signal.

When harbor drive light turns red, the traffic backs up on that light filling 32nd street with cars. At that point, the light on the 15 exit turns green and a few cars at a time get a chance to go. This backs up the 15 exit immensely and cars wait and sit for 40 minutes to an hour depending on where the line starts. Some days there is no line and it seems to be a non issue.  But out of the 5 days I come to work, I would say 3 to 4 days it is like this. Time is anywhere between 545 to 745 area. Thanks",spatial,address not given in email?
