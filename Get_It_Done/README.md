# Get It Done
I interviewed with PandA (City of San Diego) in mid-2019 and as part of the process I QA'd some GID data

The 2016-2019 GID data (> 40k rows) is generally sound but could be cleaner.
1. Spatial data indicated that GID may not have an accurate accounting of City boundaries,
especially at the coast and piers/jetties.
2. It was unclear to me how GID handles cases outside the City limits and if there are
limited cases (trash pick-up?) that are serviced by CoSD.
3. There is a pattern of missing fields from internal reports, mostly from Stormwater
4. There are opportunities to provide more specific categories at the app/web interface.
This would reduce the number of other or blank service_name values (water,
homelessness, and mobility categories especially)
